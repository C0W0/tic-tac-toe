The abstract parent class for every game state
Contains necessary fields and abstract methods for the basic
functionality of a state

List of Global Variables:
States - an array of states that contains all states required for the
	game. This is a static variable and will be referred for state
	switching </type State[]>
uiManager - An object that stores all of the buttons and tracks button
     </type BufferedImage[][]>
game - the reference (pointer) of the main game object. It is passed and
	stored in every single state for state switching </type Game>
